## Inspiration
As blockchain lovers and developers, we hope to promote blockchain education so that more people can participate in the world of web3.

More than 80% of the current blockchain applications are financial applications  which means that most people are currently attracted by blockchain financial applications, such as unregulated cryptocurrency, efficient and automated DeFi, etc., It can effectively solve many disadvantages of traditional finance, and we also agree that financial applications are the key to the blockchain being promoted out of the circle.

Therefore, we decided to develop a game that predicts the rise and fall of investment targets on the blockchain, and open it to members of the University Blockchain Research Institute first, so that students have more opportunities to understand the blockchain and use it in practice, we believe that it can attract young people. We would like to see new bloods joining web3 or even participate in the development.

In addition, we also want to encourage users to learn financial and investment knowledge through the game of predicting market prices, because we firmly believe that investment and financial knowledge are something that everyone should learn and use for life.

In short, we hope to make blockchain and financial applications go out of the circle through enjoy prediction, so that more people can ride this wave and avoid becoming a lamb to be slaughtered under the rise and fall of finance.

## What it does
1. Login to the app using their web3 wallet.
2. Predict whether the investment target will rise or fall in the future, and bet against the other party.
3. Users who make successful predictions can share 99% of the total bonus pool according to the investment ratio.
4. All users can compete for the right to settle after 7pm Taiwan time. (The settlement is the settlement of yesterday's prediction results, and those who settle can get 1% of the total fund pool as a reward).
5. Users who make a successful prediction can claim the reward at any time, which means that they can claim after accumulating multiple victories.

## How we built it
1. Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind CSS +sass)
2. Backend (Next.js)
3. API - (TradingView API)
4. Smart contract (Solidity)
5. Oracle (Chainlink Price Feed)
6. Blockchain (Polygon)

## Challenges we ran into
1. Designing the game rules took us some time because it has to be fair, acceptable for everyone and also codable.
2. State managements are quite complicated not only at the frontend but also in smart contract. We have to handle the state very well keep the app simple, works smooth for users.(UX part)
3. Design this app as a product, we made efforts on the UI part. The components are well designed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Develop interesting betting and guessing games for education. Everything is transparent and open source, inheriting the idea of ​​decentralization, without any trust issues (not only the program are running on blockchain and also we uses Chainlink price feed), users can rest assured to bet and participate in the game, this is to let the blockchain and cryptocurrency go out of the circle.

## What we learned
1. We can handle the states better in a project.
2. Tailwindcss is a powerful UI developing tool
3. How to design a game that people would love to have a try

## What's next for EnJoy Prediction
1. We will develop social features such as enable users to mint their soulbound token which contains their profile. 
2. Users can chat with this identity.
3.  Users can meet a random new friend everyday.
